# Weather Now

Weather application that actually tells the actual current (extreme) weather condition (like snow, drought, high water, etc) based on empirical data from [darksky](http://darksky.net/api) and [AccuWeather](http://accuweather.com). It will use an RNN, which is pre-trained on financial timeseries data, to amalgamate the most important weather information (wind speed, humidity, past condition, ...) to a current prediciton of the weather.
